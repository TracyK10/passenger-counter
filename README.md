# People Counter Application

This is a simple JavaScript application that allows users to increment a count and save the count along with previous entries. The application consists of an HTML file (`index.html`), a JavaScript file (`script.js`), and an optional stylesheet (`styles.css`).

## Functionality

The application provides the following features:

- **Increment Counter:** Clicking the "INCREMENT" button increases the count displayed on the page.

- **Save Counter:** Clicking the "SAVE" button saves the current count along with a dash ("-") to a list of previous entries. After saving, the count is reset to zero.
